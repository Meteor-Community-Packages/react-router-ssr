# React-Router-SSR

Simple isomorphic React SSR for Meteor with subscribed data re-hydration

## Supporting the project ‚ù§Ô∏è

This project, like all of the projects maintained by the Meteor Community Packages org, takes time and hard work to keep updated. If you find this or any of our other packages useful, consider visiting the sponsor section of a repo and sending some love to the dedicated developers that keep your favorite packages up to date.

### Upgrading from v3 to v4

Update to `react-router-dom` to v6

### Upgrading from v4 to v5

This package now requires React 18 and uses Data Routers from React Router v5. Because of this there are several modifications that you will need to make to your app to upgrade. Also support for Redux and Styled Components has been removed from this package. You will need to find a new way to support them in your app.

The following steps are things you may need to do to upgrade your app from using v4 to v5 of this package:

1. Update `react` to v18
2. Update `react-router-dom` to v6 if you haven't already
3. Install `abort-controller` with `npm install abort-controller`
4. Rewrite your root component to either be a JSX fragment containing `<Route>` components, or an array of Route object.
5. If you are using Redux or Styled Components, this package no longer has built in support for them. You will need to explore how to architect your app to support them.

## Install

1. First install NPM dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install --save react@18 react-dom@18 react-router-dom@6 react-helmet@6 abort-controller@3
   ```

2. Install `communitypackages:react-router-ssr`

   ```sh
   meteor add communitypackages:react-router-ssr
   ```

## Package Exports üì¶

**`renderWithSSR(routes, [options])`** - Isomorphic app rendering.

- `routes` - A JSX element or array of JSX elements that represent the routes of your app.

- `options` - An object of rendering options.

  - _`renderTarget`_ - A string specifying the `id` of the element to render your app into. Default is `react-target`

  ```js
  import { renderWithSSR } from "meteor/communitypackages:react-router-ssr";

  const AppRoutes = [
    { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
    { path: "/about", element: <About /> },
  ]

  renderWithSSR(AppRoutes, {
    renderTarget: 'react-app',
  });
  ```

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

By default this package renders your app into an HTML element with an id of `react-target`, so add one to your main HTML file for your project like so, or specify a different id using the `renderTarget` option

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
</head>
<body>
  <div id="react-target"></div>
</body>
```

In shared code, such as in a `/both/main.jsx` file, or in a file that is imported into your `mainModule` for both the client and server..

```jsx
import { renderWithSSR } from "meteor/communitypackages:react-router-ssr";

import React from "react";
import DashboardPage from "./imports/ui/pages/dashbaord";
import ProfilePage from "./imports/ui/pages/profile";
import LoginPage from "./imports/ui/pages/login";

const AppRoutes = [
  { path: "/", element: <DashboardPage /> },
  { path: "/profile/:username", element: <ProfilePage /> },
  { path: "/login", element: <LoginPage /> },
];

// Alternatively you can use a JSX fragment
// const AppRoutes = (
//   <>
//     <Route path="/" element={<DashboardPage />} />
//     <Route path="/profile/:username" element={<ProfilePage />} />
//     <Route path="/login" element={<LoginPage />} />
//   </>
// );

renderWithSSR(AppRoutes);
```
